## BREAK DOWN OF MY MESSENGER:
1. There is a start menu which prompts the user to create a profile or load an existing one.
2. After my main menu will be printed. At this time all the bottons and chat boxes are disabled
3. When the user clicks on a contact in treeview, the chat history will display and all buttons will bve enabled
4. My program also looks for new messages every 5 seconds. 
5. The file menu contains options to create a new user, open a existing user, or quit the program.
NOTEWORTHY FEATURES:
1. My code keeps track of messages that remain in the message box when the user switches between contacts
2. I have alot of custom message boxes that come up to notify the user when something doesn't happen. For example, if someone
changes their username to empty spaces the operation won't be processed. The same happens when some doesn't enter enough 
info when creating a user or adding a contact.
3. The chat history is in printed in reverse to mimic model IM software in that you scroll up to view previous messages and
not down.
4. When someone who isn't friended sends you a message they will be added to the contact list automatically.
5. The bottom left corner contains the users name and the server that they are on.
6. When clicking the new user and open user buttons the loaded user will be logged out and the gui will be reset.
